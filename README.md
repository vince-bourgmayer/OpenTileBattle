# Open Tile Battle

start date: December 2023

## Description

Open source game inspired by Terra Battle from mistwalker studio

For development purpose, some resources have been gathered on terra battle fandom wiki.

There is no goal to release those sources to public. This point may change, but in this case, all
properties of a third party (e.g Mistwalker) must be replaced firstly by open source resources.

The game should be a free single player.
We could also imagine in future a custom software or element to allow anyone (if project is released)
to create their home custom characters and scenarios.
