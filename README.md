# Open Tile Battle

start date: December 2023

It was a personal challenges:
1. Was I able to use godot to produce something
2. Was I able to reproduce the basic mechanism of Terra battle from Mistwalker.


## Description

Open source game inspired by Terra Battle from mistwalker studio

For development purpose, some resources have been gathered on terra battle fandom wiki.

There is no goal to release those sources to public. This point may change, but in this case, all
properties of their respective owner (e.g Mistwalker) must be replaced firstly by open source resources.

The game should be a free single player.
One idea for later, let user to create their own custom characters, skills, etc. and scenarios.
